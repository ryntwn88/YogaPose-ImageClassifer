    "## Google Image Web Scraper with Selenium in Julia/Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to collect images from the web to use for training and testing a neural network for image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) is a convenient Python package for controlling a web browser using code, automating web scraping processes. I was unable to find an equivalently convenient package that replaces the fuctionality of ```selenium``` in pure Julia, but ```PyCall``` makes calling Python packages from Julia very easy!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many good tutorials available on scraping Google Images with ```selenium``` and I chose to use this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@wwwanandsuresh/web-scraping-images-from-google-9084545808a2) from Anand Suresh posted on Medium as my guide.  Using his code as the base I modified out of need for Julia language differences and some personal preference and conveniences."
