# YogaPose-ImageClassifer
Using Neural Networks to Classify Yoga Poses in Images

In this project I am practicing a simple image classification task using convolutional neural networks.  I created a dataset of yoga poses by scraping approximately 6.7k images (5.5k in train set, 1.2k in test set) from Google Images for 24 different poses (250-300 examples per pose) and train a variety of models using TensorFlow in Python and Flux in Julia.

The main purpose of this project is to explore and practice machine learning workflows for image classification.
