# YogaPose-ImageClassifer
Using Neural Networks to Classify Yoga Poses in Images

In this project I am practicing a simple image classification task using convolutiona neural networks.  I created a dataset of yoga poses by scraping Google Images for 24 different poses and train a variety of models using TensorFlow in Python and Flux in Julia.

The main purpose of this project is to explore and practice machine learning workflows for image classification.
